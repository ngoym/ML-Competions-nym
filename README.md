# ML-Competions-nym
A collection of my solution in various machine learning competitions.

I mostly participate in competitions hosted on [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/) where I compete as `nymfree` and my current ranking is No. 11 out of more than 10000 competitors from around the globe.

I am self-taught and currently do anything machine learning / deep learning / AI as a hobby.
